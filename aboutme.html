    <h1><b>This is my About me page</b></h1>
    <p style="font-size:200%;">My name is Noah Shields and this is my about me page. Here I will give you a desription of myself and my interests.
    Let's Begin, First off I am a Junior at Don Antonio Lugo High School. I consider myself sociable funny and easy going.
    My interests comprise of Math, Music, Playing Bass and Clothing. I like math because it makes me challenge myself, My 
    favorite areas of math is Linear Algebra, Graph Theory and Differential Equations. I love them but its impossible
    to self study because everything is a pre-quisite
    of something else so it is hard to find a starting point to learn a new subject, But i love it nonetheless.
    Other than that music has been my passion for years ive been playing the bass for about 3 years and producing music for about 2 years.
Im very expierienced when it comes to both the hardware and software to making music but there is still so much to learn.
Then theres lifting weights, this is fairly new to mebut its exilirating it gets my blood flowing and makes my adrenaline flow.
lifting weights is very demanding in every aspect such as  sticking to a diet  making time for the gym and just pushing your self to new limits
but the progress you make after a few weeks of intense training makes it all worth it.
i love lifting because it is very rewarding in both the short and long term.
Lastly My absolute favorite is Clothing. I love dressing up. 
It gives me a sense a freedom in my everyday life thats hard to find anywhere else. The only downside is that i have expensive
tastes and it can be hard to find something that really speaks to me and stay within my budget.</p>
